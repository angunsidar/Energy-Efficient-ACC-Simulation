CONTENTS:
1. S_Angun_EV_ACC_Research_Report.pdf 
   - Full academic report including methodology, results, and discussion.
   
2. Source_Code/ACC_Simulation_Source_Code.m
   - The MATLAB script used to generate all data and figures in the report.
   - Requires MATLAB R2020a or newer.
   - No external toolboxes required.

HOW TO RUN:
Open the .m file in MATLAB and click "Run". The script will:
1. Generate a stochastic traffic scenario.
2. Simulate both Static and Dynamic vehicles.
3. Output the "Death Point" analysis to the command window.
4. Plot the comparison figures (Velocity, SoC, Efficiency).
